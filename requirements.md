# Use Case: Customer 360 View Application for a Retail Organization
## Objective:
Enable the retail organization to achieve a unified view of customer interactions and data from multiple channels (e.g., CRM, order management, social media, etc.) to drive customer personalization, support, and targeted marketing.

Components Involved
# Salesforce – Acts as the central CRM for managing customer data, including profiles, purchase history, and support interactions.
# MuleSoft – Integrates data from Salesforce, external systems, and Kafka streams. MuleSoft APIs standardize and manage data flow and orchestration.
# Java & Spring Boot – Backend services built in Spring Boot handle business logic, provide REST APIs, and consume/produce messages in Kafka.
# Apache Kafka – Manages real-time data streams, capturing customer interactions across various systems and enabling asynchronous processing.
# Solution Architecture
# Customer Interactions & Data Ingestion

Every customer interaction (e.g., purchase, support call, social media mention) across multiple channels (e-commerce platform, social media, in-store, etc.) is captured in real-time.
MuleSoft APIs orchestrate this data by integrating with these various sources and send relevant information to Salesforce.
Real-Time Event Streaming with Kafka

As each customer interaction is recorded, MuleSoft publishes an event to a Kafka topic (e.g., customer-events-topic).
Kafka topics handle data related to events such as purchases, support requests, and customer preferences, allowing for a real-time feed of customer behavior.
Spring Boot Microservices

Customer Profile Service (Spring Boot) consumes events from customer-events-topic and enriches the customer data within the application.
Personalization Service (Spring Boot) also consumes Kafka events, identifying patterns and providing insights for personalization. For example, if a customer frequently buys athletic wear, it may send promotions or recommendations in line with that preference.
Both services update Salesforce with new insights and data points by using MuleSoft API calls to Salesforce, which keeps Salesforce CRM updated in real time.
MuleSoft APIs

Data Transformation API – Standardizes and transforms data from various systems into a uniform format before sending it to Kafka and Salesforce.
Salesforce API Connector – Provides a direct connection between the MuleSoft platform and Salesforce to push/pull relevant data, ensuring the CRM is always up to date.
Event Orchestration API – Controls the flow of data between Kafka, Spring Boot services, and Salesforce, acting as the backbone for data consistency across systems.
Salesforce as a Central CRM

Salesforce acts as the centralized data store for customer information, managed through data synchronization facilitated by MuleSoft.
Salesforce Service Cloud is used by support teams to view a unified profile of each customer, including interactions and engagement metrics updated in real time.
Workflow Example
A customer makes an in-store purchase, which triggers an event.
MuleSoft receives this event and pushes it to customer-events-topic in Kafka.
The Customer Profile Service and Personalization Service consume this event.
The Customer Profile Service enriches the data and updates the unified customer profile.
The Personalization Service analyzes the purchase history and updates relevant data in Salesforce for targeted marketing.
MuleSoft then triggers an API call to Salesforce to update the customer's profile, ensuring CRM is up-to-date.
The next time the customer contacts support, the representative sees the updated, unified profile and can provide personalized support.
Benefits
Real-Time Customer Insights – Leveraging Kafka and Spring Boot allows the system to handle high volumes of data in real time, ensuring that Salesforce is always up-to-date with the latest interactions.
Seamless Integration with MuleSoft – Using MuleSoft as a bridge ensures that data from various systems can be normalized and synchronized effortlessly.
Improved Customer Personalization – Through real-time updates to Salesforce, marketing and support teams can engage with customers in a highly targeted way, increasing satisfaction and loyalty.
